  <h1> Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm RONALD LOPEZ </h1>
  
  Here is a little description of myself and an explanatory version of why I am the proper professional to take care of your project.

  My greatest professional impulse is the search for continuous improvement in my knowledge and experiences, I am a goal-oriented person, 
  I rely heavily on prior planning as the main vehicle to achieve my individual goals and I am aware that the only way to success is it is 
  the action, so I am always willing to make all the sacrifices concerned to achieve success.

 My main added value is my ability to commit to the individual goals of my client in their project, I am very clear about the fact that the 
 success of my client is therefore my own success and that each project and request that I generate an ultra-satisfied client with the final 
 product is an addiction to my professional background, which is why every time an estimate is entrusted to me, I dedicate 100% of my dedication, 
 attention, commitment and performance, each task represents my own identity as a profession and my ambition is that this professional identity is 
 synonymous with excellence and quality in execution.
